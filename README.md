# vxtwitter-bot
This bot originally only worked with Twitter links, hence the name. I have expanded
its capabilities to now embed the following:

Twitter
Reddit
Tiktok
Instagram

I will continue to improve this bot at my own convenience. This is a personal project.

## setup
You will need to create a .env file after cloning the repo. The below shows what you will
need to put in the .env file so the bot will work.

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YourTokenHere
```

I recommend running this in a Python Docker Container.

Below is an example of what you would need to do before running this bot on your system.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
